## Gym_churn_kmeans

The Model Fitness gym chain aims to implement a customer interaction strategy based on data analysis to reduce the churn rate.

### Problem Statement:
Customer churn is one of the main challenges in service industries like gyms. However, identifying when a customer has stopped using the service is not always straightforward. While some cancellations are explicit (contract termination), others are implicit (customers who stop attending without formally canceling).

Definition of Churn:
For this project, a customer is defined as "lost" after a full month has passed without them making a visit. While there may be exceptions (such as vacations), the typical pattern indicates that customers who stop attending for this period have a minimal probability of returning, Model Fitness has digitized its customer profiles.

### Objective:
The goal of this project is to:

Analyze customer behavior and profile data.

Identify segments with a high probability of churn using clustering techniques.

Propose specific retention strategies for each identified segment.

### Technologies used:
* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
* scipy
* seaborn
* sklearn

### Results

Customer segments with up to a 51% probability of churn were identified, along with correlations showing the variables that have the greatest impact on their decision to leave.
